### The SparseMeanRevertingOracle produces a fundamental value time series for
### each requested symbol, and provides noisy observations of the fundamental
### value upon agent request.  This "sparse discrete" fundamental uses a
### combination of two processes to produce relatively realistic synthetic
### "values": a continuous mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process plus
### periodic "megashocks" which arrive following a Poisson process and have
### magnitude drawn from a bimodal normal distribution (overall mean zero,
### but with modes well away from zero).  This is necessary because OU itself
### is a single noisy return to the mean (from a perturbed initial state)
### that does not then depart the mean except in terms of minor "noise".

### Historical dates are effectively meaningless to this oracle.  It is driven by
### the numpy random number seed contained within the experimental config file.
### This oracle uses the nanoseconds portion of the current simulation time as
### discrete "time steps".

### This version of the MeanRevertingOracle expects agent activity to be spread
### across a large amount of time, with relatively sparse activity.  That is,
### agents each acting at realistic "retail" intervals, on the order of seconds
### or minutes, spread out across the day.
