### nanosecond delay on communication [from][to] agent ID.

# Square numpy array with dimensions equal to total agent count.  Most agents are handled
# at init, drawn from a uniform distribution from:
# Times Square (3.9 miles from NYSE, approx. 21 microseconds at the speed of light) to:
# Pike Place Starbucks in Seattle, WA (2402 miles, approx. 13 ms at the speed of light).
